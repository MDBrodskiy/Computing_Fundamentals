\begin{itemize}

  \item General Guidelines of Python Coding

    \begin{itemize}

      \item No variable declaration; however, variables must be initialized before use

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Variable names are case-sensitive

          \item Variable identifiers may consist of letters, digits, and underscores, but may not begin with a digit

        \end{itemize}

      \item Many of the high-level programming languages like C, C++, or C# use braces \{\} to mark a block of code; Python does it via indentation

        \begin{itemize}

          \item A code block representing the body of a function or a loop begins with the indentation and ends with the first unindented line

          \item Most programming languages provide indentation for better code formatting and don't enforce to have it

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Python Data Types

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Python determines the type of a literal directly from the syntax at runtime

      \item Boolean (bool): True or False

      \item Numeric: int, float, and complex

      \item String (str): `myStr', ``myStr''

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
